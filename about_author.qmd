# About the Author {.unnumbered}

**Aiyebogun Onyebi Gloria** is a psychologist, mental health educator, and founder of The Self-Care Clinic—a women's wellness initiative built on the belief that healing is not just about surviving, but about refilling your cup and reclaiming your joy.

With a Master's degree in Social and Terrorism Psychology, and years of experience working with women in emotional and mental recovery, Gloria brings empathy, insight, and authenticity to every page. Her writing is rooted in her passion for helping women rediscover peace after pain, rebuild self-worth, and find strength in their own stories.

When she's not working with women or facilitating healing programs, Gloria enjoys quiet walks, soft music, and heart-to-heart conversations that remind people they are never alone.
