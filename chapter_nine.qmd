# A Final Word {.unnumbered}

Dear woman,

You've walked through heartbreak and found your strength. You've cried, healed, and learned to love yourself again. You've chosen peace — and that's your victory.

Healing didn't change you into someone new. It helped you remember who you've been all along — worthy, enough, and whole.

Now go live freely, laugh loudly, love wisely, and walk proudly in the light of your healing. Because when love hurts, it doesn't mean your story is over — it means a new, softer, wiser chapter has begun.

Yours Truly

Gloria
